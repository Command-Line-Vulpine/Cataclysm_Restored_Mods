# Cataclysm: Restored

Cataclysm: Restored is a fan fork of Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world.  The purpose of this fork is to remove more recent changes to the game a portion of the fanbase does not like, and restore old features that were removed.  This build will not be for everyone, nor is it intended to.  It is likely to have bugs and half-implemented changes, as I am only an amateur at modding.

### MOD INFO!
This is the mod version of Cataclysm Restored!  This lacks any changes that can only be done by compiling the game.  Example: Game defaults to single-pool points system.  Rename "survivor" back to Freeform.


## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why is this necessary?

A growing set of the fanbase has been dissatisfied with the direction the devs have been taking the base game; starting from around 0.E Stable onward.  Most recently, with 0.H Stable and experimentals beyond that are starting to aggravate a much larger portion of the fanbase.  The direction of the game has become very confused, with an over-focus on "realism" at the sacrifice of fun.

#### Why this instead of Bright Nights?

I've heard and found Bright Nights adjustments to be somewhat inconsistent, as well as being outdated.  For instance, I've heard it doesn't have the new inventory system added in 0.F â€“ we're to 0.H now.  There are some features that have been added I think should stay, such as that inventory system.

#### Why you?

I'm no professional developer, but I'm not new to making mods.  Back in the 0.C era I made the Five Nights at Freddy's mod that added the animatronics and pizzeria to the game.  I also made the Lightfire Union mod for Stellaris which added a full fox furry race to the game using (with permission) artwork by real artists.  I've also done minor modifications for myself to CDDA when I play it.  Lastly, I've been playing CDDA since pre-0.A, all on camera for YouTube - and so I feel I have a strong understanding of the original direction of the game; and a good chance of putting it back on track.

#### What do you plan to change?

Generally, Restored intends to return old features of the game, and disable old ones.  Not everything, in either case; but an attempt to merge the new and old in a positive way.  Basically imagine if the difficulty and lore direction of the game from say 0.D was continued to 0.H without pivoting.  The following is a list of changes made so far:


v 0.2

1. Buffed makeshift crowbar, cudgel, and quarterstaff to older stats.
2. Removed welding rod requirements; also added easy ways to make them, as a backup.
3. Boosted cotton sheet output from dissembling sheets.
4. Game defaults to single-pool points system.  Rename "survivor" back to Freeform.
5. Added body pillow variants to Undead_People tileset.
6. Obligatory self-insert OC on Fox Body Pillow. Just MShock and Undead_People.
7. Added back in AEP suit and ANBC suit, currently just dropped by Hazmat zombies.
8. Added back in Chicken Walker and Tank Drone.

v 0.1

1. Acid rain added back in.
2. Portal storms are removed.
3. Max item length of storage items massively increased.
4. Breathability of most materials vastly increased.
5. Increased stamina regen.
5. Added Undead_People and made it the default tileset.
6. Added AcPlus_ToshibaSat_8x16 as the default text font, and Topaz-8 as the default map fonts.

To-Do list

* Add in other removed monsters people want back.
* Make it so dissecting certain types of zombies yields CBMs again.
* Add back in various types of vending machines and ATMs.
* Add more locations with auto-docs.
* Add back in self-installing CBMs (should be more difficult and dangerous than an autodoc).
* Add turning portal storms back on as a mod.
* Add some way to get the benefits from portal storms without turning them on.
* Check drugs and increase their stat bonuses closer to what they used to be.
* Make loot pools more random, particularly in houses.
* Double check guns an ammo.  Add back in fan favorite weapons that were removed.  Make sure ammo is accessible for rare guns, perhaps via vending machine.
* Further simplifying crafting.
* Restore old traits.  Packmule boosting carry volume by 20%, Trigger Happy if possible.
